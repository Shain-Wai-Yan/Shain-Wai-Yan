## 🔹 About Me

I come from a humble background with limited resources, yet my curiosity and relentless drive have pushed me beyond what I once imagined possible. Without a computer science degree, I taught myself to build full-stack web applications and architect complex systems using modern tools — all while pursuing a BA in Literature and earning professional certificates in Digital Marketing and E-Commerce.

My passion lies at the intersection of **marketing, technology, and creativity**. I combine strategic business thinking with hands-on technical skills to create websites, marketing solutions, and tools that deliver real impact.

## 🔹 My Journey

Growing up in a rural environment with scarce educational resources, I was one of the few in my generation to attend university. Learning coding and web architecture without formal training has been challenging but rewarding. I leverage AI tools for coding assistance, but I drive all projects with my ideas, design, and business goals.

At 22, I’ve already created complex websites, earned Google and Meta certifications, and built a foundation for a future in tech and marketing — all fueled by persistence and a thirst for learning.
